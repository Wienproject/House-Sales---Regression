Regression Algorithm Machine Learning - House Sales in King County USA

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle.

It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.


In this project, I am trying to use different base models, including polynomial for linear regression and
Hyper paramter Tuning for Random Forest Base Model to obtain higher R2 Score.

Concluded, it is Random Forest Regressor (Base Model) which we use to be the model for this project, caused by its highest r2 Score.
